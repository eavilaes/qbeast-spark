---
**Qbeast Spark** extension is a **data lakehouse** enhancement that enables **multi-dimensional indexing** and **efficient data sampling** with **ACID** properties.

We achieve these functionalities by combining the **recursive space division** algorithm for indexing with data **de-normalization** and a set of query optimization rules developed for Spark.


<br/>
 
## Features

1. **Data Lakehouse** - Data lake with **ACID** properties, thanks to the underlying Delta Lake architecture


2. **Multi-column indexing**:  Instead of partitioning or bucketing, index,  organize and filter your data with multiple columns using the Qbeast Format.
   

3. **Improved Sampling operator** - Efficiently reading statistically significant subsets. Thanks to our Sampling push down operator, samples do not need to load all data in memory. You retrieve only the data you need.
   

4. **Table Tolerance** - Model for sampling fraction and query accuracy trade-off. How big should be a sample? Don't worry about that, Qbeast can calculate the sample size that for your query.

## Getting Started

>### Warning: DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!
> This project is in an early development phase: there are missing functionalities and the API might change drastically.

> See Issues tab to know what is cooking 😎



### Setting up
1 - Install [**sbt**(>=1.4.7)](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

2 - Install **Spark**:
Download **Spark(3.1.1)**, unzip it, and create the `SPARK_HOME` environment variable:

```bash
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.1.1/spark-3.1.1-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz

tar xzvf spark-3.1.1-bin-hadoop3.2.tgz

export SPARK_HOME=$PWD/spark-3.1.1-bin-hadoop3.2
 ```
 
3 - Project packaging:
 
Clone the repo, navigate to the repository folder, and package the project through **sbt**. [JDK 8](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-8-lts&package=jdk) is recommended. 
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Qbeast-io/qbeast-spark.git

cd qbeast-spark

sbt assembly
```

### Quickstart
You can run the qbeast-spark application locally on your computer, or using a Docker image we already prepared with the dependencies.
You can find it in the [Packages section](https://github.com/orgs/Qbeast-io/packages?repo_name=qbeast-spark).

1 - Launch a **spark-shell**

**Inside the project folder**, launch a **spark shell** with the required dependencies:

```bash
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell \
--jars ./target/scala-2.12/qbeast-spark-assembly-0.1.0.jar \
--conf spark.sql.extensions=io.qbeast.spark.sql.QbeastSparkSessionExtension \
--packages io.delta:delta-core_2.12:0.8.0
```

2- Indexing a dataset and examine the **query plan** for sampling:

Read the CSV source file placed inside the project.

```scala
val csv_df = (spark.read.format("csv")
  .option("header", "true")
  .option("inferSchema", "true")
  .load("./src/test/resources/ecommerce100K_2019_Oct.csv"))
```

Indexing the dataset by writing it into the **qbeast** format, specifying the columns to index.

```scala
val tmp_dir = "/tmp/qbeast-spark"

csv_df.write
	.mode("overwrite")
	.format("qbeast")
	.option("columnsToIndex", "user_id,product_id")
	.save(tmp_dir)
```

Load the newly indexed dataset.

```scala
val qbeast_df =
   spark
     .read
     .format("qbeast")
     .load(tmp_dir)
```

Sampling the data, notice how the sampler is converted into filters and pushed down to the source!

```scala
qbeast_df.sample(0.1).explain(true)
```

Go to the [Quickstart](./docs/Quickstart.md) or [notebook](docs/sample_pushdown_demo.ipynb) for more details.

## Contribution Guide


Help is always welcome! There’s always code that can be clarified and variables or functions that can be renamed or commented on. A need for more test coverage or documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement. The point is - if you see something you think should be fixed, own it. Now let's get started.


To find Qbeast issues that make good entry points:

- Start with issues labelled **good first issue**. For example, see the good first issues in the repository for updates to the core Qbeast Spark code.

- For issues that require deeper knowledge of one or more technical aspects, look at issues labelled **help wanted**.
